# 💸Financial-Fraud-Detection-in-Healthcare-Using-Machine-Learning-Techniques

This project focuses on detecting fraudulent activities in healthcare financial data using machine learning techniques. Fraudulent claims, billing anomalies, and other irregularities are identified to help reduce financial loss and improve healthcare system efficiency.
# 📖 About
Healthcare fraud costs billions of dollars every year. This project uses supervised machine learning models to detect fraudulent transactions, including false claims, duplicate billing, and upcoding, by analyzing healthcare datasets and predicting suspicious activities.

# ✨ Features
1 Data preprocessing and cleaning

2 Feature selection and engineering

3 Model building with ML algorithms (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost)

4 Model evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC

5 Visualization of fraud patterns and model performance

6 Predictive system to flag potentially fraudulent records
